	+ 'extern' keyword allows you to use variables defined by the program and reads values from the memory.
	With 'extern', you are saying that this variable is defined in somewhere and defined before by the program.
	This means that you can use 'scanf()' function for filling your primary variables just like you did in a single 'main()' function.
	You should NOT write 'extern' at the beginning of variables in read_input() function. Lines [10-14] are enough.

	+ When return type is 'void', you don't return anything.
	Just for your information, if you really want to return and halt function execution at some point, use "return;".
	However, this is not necessary for read_input() function of course.
