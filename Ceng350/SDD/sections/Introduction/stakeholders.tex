There are several different stakeholders within the system.

\paragraph*{1. Users} \mbox{}\\
Users (can be seen as end-users) are the people who use the microscope for their daily tasks. The main concerns of the users are the easy usability of the microscope, the privacy of their IP addresses, and using the microscope without any technical issues. They want a simple user interface, secure database and to be able to connect to the system both remotely and locally.

\paragraph*{2. Admins} \mbox{}\\
Admins are authorized people who are responsible for the management of the microscope. Their main concerns are managing the system settings to customize microscope preferences to provide a better and controlled user experience. They also want to see details of the connected users and be able to block/unblock users to maintain the security of the microscope. Finally, since they use admin keys to login to the system, they want these passwords to be kept securely.

\paragraph*{3. Maintainers} \mbox{}\\
Maintainers are authorized people who are responsible for keeping system software up to date and solving the technical and software-related issues in the system. They want to see the latest software releases, be able to update system software and view detailed system logs related to the problems that occured in the system. Finally, since they use maintainer keys to login to the system, they want these passwords to be kept securely.
