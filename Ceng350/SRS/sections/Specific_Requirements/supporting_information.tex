\begin{itemize}
	\item One of the application areas of the system is education \cite{education}. Therefore it is reasonable to allow the connections of multiple users.
	\item Quick connection and practical usage is important for microscopes. Requiring users to register to use the microscope severely damages the practical use principle. Therefore, it is reasonable to see users as connections rather than detailed profiles. As a result, a user can easily and quickly connect to the microscope without any registration procedure.
