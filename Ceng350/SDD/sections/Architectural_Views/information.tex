\subsubsection{Design Rationale}
\paragraph{Interface Class Diagram}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Report Handler is responsible for creating and storing logs related to hardware failures and login errors.
	\item Both Display Controller and Position Controller associated with the Report Handler to report hardware related problems.
	\item Authentication System is associated with the Report Handler to report suspicious login attempts.
	\item To allow the maintainers to use View System Logs function defined in use-case diagram, Maintainers component uses the interface provided by the Report Handler.
	\item To allow the admins to use Block User and Unblock User functions defined in use-case diagram, Admins part is associated with the User Accounts part.
	\item To be able to store the captured images, scans and recorded videos, Display Controller is associated with the Gallery.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Database Class Diagram}
\begin{itemize}
	\item For easy and fast usability of the microscope, users do not have to authenticate to the system. Therefore, for user records, password information is omitted.
	\item To avoid repetition of the attributes, Media, System Log and Staff parent classes are defined. 
	\item To be able to handle different types of errors, Login Attempt Log and Failure Log classes are created.
	\item To allow the maintainer to use View System Logs function defined in use-case diagram, Maintainer and System Logs classes are linked to each other.
\end{itemize}
