/*
	+ Function arguments are:
		++ min_required_ships:		Array of minimum number of ships required for each customer.
		++ customer_count:			Customer count, which is also length of min_required_ships.
		++ available_captain_count:	The number of captains available in the harbour for shipment.

	+ Returns:
		The number of customers whose ship requirements are satisfied. 
		Try to maximize the number of satisfied customers. 
		sort_integer_array() function is given for you as a HINT. There should be a reason for that.

	+ "return -1" is just a placeholder. Please change it after you implemented this function.
