The purpose of this project is to design a customizable, low-cost and locally-manufacturable \cite{local} microscope that can be easily built by people from all over the world. Unlike complex and expensive microscopes, OpenFlexure Microscope can be built using 3d machines in low-cost and even an inexperienced person can easily assemble and use it.
